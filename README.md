# 👋 Hey there, I’m **algophile** — I breathe code and live algorithms, Exploring the world of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning

## 🧠 About Me

I’m a builder at heart and a systems thinker by design. From elegant APIs to decentralized protocols and neural networks, I craft software that scales — in performance, impact, and elegance.

🚀 Currently shaping ideas at the intersection of:

- **🕸️ Web Development** — building robust backends & dynamic frontends using:
  - `Go`, `Rust`, `Node.js`, `Next.js`, `NestJS`

- **🌐 Web3** — architecting decentralized systems with:
  - `Solana`, `Solidity`

- **🧬 Machine Learning / Deep Learning** — researching and deploying models in:
  - `CNN`, `RNN`, `GCN`, `Transformers`, `Reinforcement Learning`
  - Building production ML pipelines with `MLOps`

## 🧩 Philosophy

> _"Code is poetry. Architecture is thought. Simplicity is depth."_

I believe the best systems are ones that feel inevitable — not because they were simple to write, but because they were deeply understood.
